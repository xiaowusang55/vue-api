# methods

* Type: `{ [key: string]: Function }`

* Details:
Methods to be mixed into the Vue instance. You can access these methods directly on the VM instance, or use them in directive expressions. All methods will have their this context automatically bound to the Vue instance.

Note that you should not use an arrow function to define a method (e.g. plus: () => this.a++). The reason is arrow functions bind the parent context, so this will not be the Vue instance as you expect and this.a will be undefined.

```js
var vm = new Vue({
  data: { a: 1 },
  methods: {
    plus: function () {
      this.a++
    }
  }
})
vm.plus()
vm.a // 2
```
