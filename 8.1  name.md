# name

* Type: string

* Restriction: only respected when used as a component option.

* Details:

Allow the component to recursively invoke itself in its template. Note that when a component is registered globally with Vue.component(), the global ID is automatically set as its name.

Another benefit of specifying a name option is debugging. Named components result in more helpful warning messages. Also, when inspecting an app in the vue-devtools, unnamed components will show up as `<AnonymousComponent>`, which isnâ€™t very informative. By providing the name option, you will get a much more informative component tree.
