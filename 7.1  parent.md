# parent

* Type: Vue instance

* Details:

Specify the parent instance for the instance to be created. Establishes a parent-child relationship between the two. The parent will be accessible as `this.$parent` for the child, and the child will be pushed into the parentâ€™s `$children` array.

Use $parent and $children sparingly - they mostly serve as an escape-hatch. Prefer using props and events for parent-child communication.
