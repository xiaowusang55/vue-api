# updated

* Type: `Function`

Details:

Called after a data change causes the virtual DOM to be re-rendered and patched.

The component’s DOM will have been updated when this hook is called, so you can perform DOM-dependent operations here. However, in most cases you should avoid changing state inside the hook. To react to state changes, it’s usually better to use a computed property or watcher instead.

Note that updated does not guarantee that all child components have also been re-rendered. If you want to wait until the entire view has been re-rendered, you can use vm.$nextTick inside of updated:

```js
update: function () {
    this.$nextTick(function () {
        // Code that will run only after the
        // entire view has been re-rendered
    })
}
```

This hook is not called during server-side rendering.
