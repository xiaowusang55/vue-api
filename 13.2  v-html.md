# v-html

* Expects: string

* Details:

Updates the element’s innerHTML. Note that the contents are inserted as plain HTML - they will not be compiled as Vue templates. If you find yourself trying to compose templates using v-html, try to rethink the solution by using components instead.

Dynamically rendering arbitrary HTML on your website can be very dangerous because it can easily lead to XSS attacks. Only use v-html on trusted content and never on user-provided content.

In single-file components, scoped styles will not apply to content inside v-html, because that HTML is not processed by Vue’s template compiler. If you want to target v-html content with scoped CSS, you can instead use CSS modules or an additional, global `<style>` element with a manual scoping strategy such as BEM.

```html
<div v-html="html"></div>
```
