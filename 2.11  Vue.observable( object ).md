# Vue.observable( object )

New in 2.6.0+

* Arguments:
-->
    `{Object} object`

* Usage:
Make an object reactive. Internally, Vue uses this on the object returned by the `data` function.

The returned object can be used directly inside render functions and computed properties, and will trigger appropriate updates when mutated. It can also be used as a minimal, cross-component state store for simple scenarios:

```js
const state = Vue.observable({ count: 0 })

const Demo = {
  render(h) {
    return h('button', {
      on: { click: () => { state.count++ }}
    }, `count is: ${state.count}`)
  }
}
```

In Vue 2.x, Vue.observable directly mutates the object passed to it, so that it is equivalent to the object returned, as demonstrated here. In Vue 3.x, a reactive proxy will be returned instead, leaving the original object non-reactive if mutated directly. Therefore, for future compatibility, we recommend always working with the object returned by Vue.observable, rather than the object originally passed to it.
