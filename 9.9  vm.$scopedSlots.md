# vm.$scopedSlots

New in 2.1.0+

* Type: { [name: string]: props => Array<VNode> | undefined }

* Read only

* Details:

Used to programmatically access scoped slots. For each slot, including the default one, the object contains a corresponding function that returns VNodes.

Accessing vm.$scopedSlots is most useful when writing a component with a render function.

Note: since 2.6.0+, there are two notable changes to this property:

1. Scoped slot functions are now guaranteed to return an array of VNodes, unless the return value is invalid, in which case the function will return undefined.

2. All $slots are now also exposed on $scopedSlots as functions. If you work with render functions, it is now recommended to always access slots via $scopedSlots, whether they currently use a scope or not. This will not only make future refactors to add a scope simpler, but also ease your eventual migration to Vue 3, where all slots will be functions
