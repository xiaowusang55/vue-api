# Vue.nextTick([callback,context])

* Arguments:
  -->
    `{Function} [callback]`
    `{Object} [context]`

* Usage:
Defer the callback to be executed after the next DOM update cycle. Use it immediately after you’ve changed some data to wait for the DOM update.

```js
// modify data
vm.msg = 'Hello'
// DOM not updated yet
Vue.nextTick(function () {
  // DOM updated
})

// usage as a promise (2.1.0+, see note below)
Vue.nextTick()
  .then(function () {
    // DOM updated
  })
```

New in 2.1.0+: returns a Promise if no callback is provided and Promise is supported in the execution environment. Please note that Vue does not come with a Promise polyfill, so if you target browsers that don’t support Promises natively (looking at you, IE), you will have to provide a polyfill yourself.
