# inheritAttrs

New in 2.4.0+

* Type: boolean

* Default: true

* Details:

By default, parent scope attribute bindings that are not recognized as props will “fallthrough” and be applied to the root element of the child component as normal HTML attributes. When authoring a component that wraps a target element or another component, this may not always be the desired behavior. By setting inheritAttrs to false, this default behavior can be disabled. The attributes are available via the $attrs instance property (also new in 2.4) and can be explicitly bound to a non-root element using v-bind.

Note: this option does not affect class and style bindings.
