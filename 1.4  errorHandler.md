# errorHandler

* Type: `Function`

* Default: `undefined`

* Usage:

```js
Vue.config.errorHandler = function (err, vm, info) {
  // handle error
  // `info` is a Vue-specific error info, e.g. which lifecycle hook
  // the error was found in. Only available in 2.2.0+
}
```

Assign a handler for uncaught errors during component render function and watchers. The handler gets called with the error and the Vue instance.

In 2.2.0+, this hook also captures errors in component lifecycle hooks. Also,when this hook is undefined, captured errors will be logged with console.errorinstead of crashing the app.

In 2.4.0+, this hook also captures errors thrown inside Vue custom event handlers.

In 2.6.0+, this hook also captures errors thrown inside v-on DOM listeners.

Inaddition, if any of the covered hooks or handlers returns a Promise chain (e.g.async functions), the error from that Promise chain will also be handled.
Error tracking services Sentry and Bugsnag provide official integrations usingthis option.
