# vm.$watch( expOrFn, callback, [options] )

* Arguments:

{string | Function} expOrFn
{Function | Object} callback
{Object} [options]
    {boolean} deep
    {boolean} immediate

* Returns: {Function} unwatch

* Usage:

Watch an expression or a computed function on the Vue instance for changes. The callback gets called with the new value and the old value. The expression only accepts dot-delimited paths. For more complex expressions, use a function instead.

Note: when mutating (rather than replacing) an Object or an Array, the old value will be the same as new value because they reference the same Object/Array. Vue doesn’t keep a copy of the pre-mutate value.

```js
// keypath
vm.$watch('a.b.c', function (newVal, oldVal) {
  // do something
})

// function
vm.$watch(
  function () {
    // every time the expression `this.a + this.b` yields a different result,
    // the handler will be called. It's as if we were watching a computed
    // property without defining the computed property itself
    return this.a + this.b
  },
  function (newVal, oldVal) {
    // do something
  }
)
```

vm.$watch returns an unwatch function that stops firing the callback:

```js
var unwatch = vm.$watch('a', cb)
// later, teardown the watcher
unwatch()
```

* Option: deep

To also detect nested value changes inside Objects, you need to pass in deep: true in the options argument. Note that you don’t need to do so to listen for Array mutations.

```js
vm.$watch('someObject', callback, {
  deep: true
})
vm.someObject.nestedValue = 123
// callback is fired
```

* Option: immediate

Passing in immediate: true in the option will trigger the callback immediately with the current value of the expression:

```js
vm.$watch('a', callback, {
  immediate: true
})
// `callback` is fired immediately with current value of `a`
```

Note that with immediate option you won’t be able to unwatch the given property on the first callback call.

```js
// This will cause an error
var unwatch = vm.$watch(
  'value',
  function () {
    doSomething()
    unwatch()
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```

If you still want to call an unwatch function inside the callback, you should check its availability first:

```js
var unwatch = vm.$watch(
  'value',
  function () {
    doSomething()
    if (unwatch) {
      unwatch()
    }
  },
  { immediate: true }
)
```
