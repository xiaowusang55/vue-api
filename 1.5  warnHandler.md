# warnHandler

New in 2.4.0+

* Type: `Function`

* Default: `undefined`

* Usage:

```js
Vue.config.warnHandler = function (msg, vm, trace) {
  // `trace` is the component hierarchy trace
}
```

Assign a custom handler for runtime Vue warnings. Note this only works during development and is ignored in production.
