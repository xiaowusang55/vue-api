# transition-group

* Props:

-->`tag` - string, defaults to span.

-->`move-class` - overwrite CSS class applied during moving transition.

-->exposes the same props as `<transition>` except `mode`.

* Events:

exposes the same events as `<transition>`.

* Usage:

`<transition-group>` serve as transition effects for multiple elements/components. The `<transition-group>` renders a real DOM element. By default it renders a `<span>`, and you can configure what element it should render via the tag attribute.

Note every child in a `<transition-group>` must be uniquely keyed for the animations to work properly.

`<transition-group>` supports moving transitions via CSS transform. When a child’s position on screen has changed after an update, it will get applied a moving CSS class (auto generated from the name attribute or configured with the move-class attribute). If the CSS transform property is “transition-able” when the moving class is applied, the element will be smoothly animated to its destination using the FLIP technique.

```html
<transition-group tag="ul" name="slide">
  <li v-for="item in items" :key="item.id">
    {{ item.text }}
  </li>
</transition-group>
```
