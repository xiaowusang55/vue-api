# keep-alive

* Props:

-->`include` - string or RegExp or Array. Only components with matching names will be cached.

-->`exclude` - string or RegExp or Array. Any component with a matching name will not be cached.

-->`max` - number. The maximum number of component instances to cache.

* Usage:

When wrapped around a dynamic component, `<keep-alive>` caches the inactive component instances without destroying them. Similar to `<transition>`,`<keep-alive>` is an abstract component: it doesn’t render a DOM element itself, and doesn’t show up in the component parent chain.

When a component is toggled inside `<keep-alive>`, its activated and deactivated lifecycle hooks will be invoked accordingly.

* In 2.2.0+ and above, activated and deactivated will fire for all nested components inside a `<keep-alive>` tree.

Primarily used to preserve component state or avoid re-rendering.

```html
<!-- basic -->
<keep-alive>
  <component :is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>

<!-- multiple conditional children -->
<keep-alive>
  <comp-a v-if="a > 1"></comp-a>
  <comp-b v-else></comp-b>
</keep-alive>

<!-- used together with `<transition>` -->
<transition>
  <keep-alive>
    <component :is="view"></component>
  </keep-alive>
</transition>
```

Note, `<keep-alive>` is designed for the case where it has one direct child component that is being toggled. It does not work if you have v-for inside it. When there are multiple conditional children, as above, `<keep-alive>` requires that only one child is rendered at a time.

* `include` and `exclude`

New in 2.1.0+

The `include` and `exclude` props allow components to be conditionally cached. Both props can be a comma-delimited string, a RegExp or an Array:

```html
<!-- comma-delimited string -->
<keep-alive include="a,b">
  <component :is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>

<!-- regex (use `v-bind`) -->
<keep-alive :include="/a|b/">
  <component :is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>

<!-- Array (use `v-bind`) -->
<keep-alive :include="['a', 'b']">
  <component :is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>
```

The match is first checked on the component’s own `name` option, then its local registration name (the key in the parent’s `components` option) if the `name` option is not available. Anonymous components cannot be matched against.

* max

New in 2.5.0+

The maximum number of component instances to cache. Once this number is reached, the cached component instance that was least recently accessed will be destroyed before creating a new instance.

```html
<keep-alive :max="10">
  <component :is="view"></component>
</keep-alive>
```

`<keep-alive>` does not work with functional components because they do not have instances to be cached.
