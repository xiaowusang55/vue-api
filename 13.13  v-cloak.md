# v-cloak

* Does not expect expression

* Usage:

This directive will remain on the element until the associated Vue instance finishes compilation. Combined with CSS rules such as [v-cloak] { display: none }, this directive can be used to hide un-compiled mustache bindings until the Vue instance is ready.

* Example:

```css
[v-cloak] {
  display: none;
}
```

```html
<div v-cloak>
  {{ message }}
</div>
```

The `<div>` will not be visible until the compilation is done.
