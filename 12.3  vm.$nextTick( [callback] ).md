# vm.$nextTick( [callback] )

* Arguments:

    {Function} [callback]

* Usage:

Defer the callback to be executed after the next DOM update cycle. Use it immediately after you’ve changed some data to wait for the DOM update. This is the same as the global Vue.nextTick, except that the callback’s this context is automatically bound to the instance calling this method.

New in 2.1.0+: returns a Promise if no callback is provided and Promise is supported in the execution environment. Please note that Vue does not come with a Promise polyfill, so if you target browsers that don’t support Promises natively (looking at you, IE), you will have to provide a polyfill yourself.

```js
new Vue({
  // ...
  methods: {
    // ...
    example: function () {
      // modify data
      this.message = 'changed'
      // DOM is not updated yet
      this.$nextTick(function () {
        // DOM is now updated
        // `this` is bound to the current instance
        this.doSomethingElse()
      })
    }
  }
})
```
