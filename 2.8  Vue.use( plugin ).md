# Vue.use( plugin )

* Arguments:
-->
    {Object | Function} plugin

* Usage:

Install a Vue.js plugin. If the plugin is an Object, it must expose an install method. If it is a function itself, it will be treated as the install method. The install method will be called with Vue as the argument.

This method has to be called before calling new Vue()

When this method is called on the same plugin multiple times, the plugin will be installed only once.
