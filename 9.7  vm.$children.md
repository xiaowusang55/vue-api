# vm.$children

* Type: `Array<Vue instance>`

* Read only

* Details:

The direct child components of the current instance. Note thereâ€™s no order guarantee for $children, and it is not reactive. If you find yourself trying to use $children for data binding, consider using an Array and v-for to generate child components, and use the Array as the source of truth.
