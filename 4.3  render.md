# render

* Type: `(createElement: () => VNode) => VNode`

* Details:
An alternative to string templates allowing you to leverage the full programmatic power of JavaScript. The render function receives a createElement method as itâ€™s first argument used to create VNodes.

If the component is a functional component, the render function also receives an extra argument context, which provides access to contextual data since functional components are instance-less.

The render function has priority over the render function compiled from template option or in-DOM HTML template of the mounting element which is specified by the el option.
