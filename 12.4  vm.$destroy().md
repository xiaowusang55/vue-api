# vm.$destroy()

* Usage:

Completely destroy a vm. Clean up its connections with other existing vms, unbind all its directives, turn off all event listeners.

Triggers the beforeDestroy and destroyed hooks.

In normal use cases you shouldnâ€™t have to call this method yourself. Prefer controlling the lifecycle of child components in a data-driven fashion using v-if and v-for.
