# computed

* Type:
    `{ [key: string]: Function | { get: Function, set: Function } }`

* Details:
Computed properties to be mixed into the Vue instance. All getters and setters have their `this` context automatically bound to the Vue instance.

Note that if you use an arrow function with a computed property, this won’t be the component’s instance, but you can still access the instance as the function’s first argument:

```js
computed: {
  aDouble: vm => vm.a * 2
}
```

Computed properties are cached, and only re-computed on reactive dependency changes. Note that if a certain dependency is out of the instance’s scope (i.e. not reactive), the computed property will not be updated.

```js
var vm = new Vue({
  data: { a: 1 },
  computed: {
    // get only
    aDouble: function () {
      return this.a * 2
    },
    // both get and set
    aPlus: {
      get: function () {
        return this.a + 1
      },
      set: function (v) {
        this.a = v - 1
      }
    }
  }
})
vm.aPlus   // => 2
vm.aPlus = 3
vm.a       // => 2
vm.aDouble // => 4
```
