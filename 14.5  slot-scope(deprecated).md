# slot-scope

Prefer v-slot in 2.6.0+.

* Expects: function argument expression

* Usage:

* Used to denote an element or component as a scoped slot. The attributeâ€™s value should be a valid JavaScript expression that can appear in the argument position of a function signature. This means in supported environments you can also use ES2015 destructuring in the expression. Serves as a replacement for scope in 2.5.0+.

* This attribute does not support dynamic binding.
