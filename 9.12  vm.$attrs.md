# vm.$attrs

New in 2.4.0+

* Type: `{ [key: string]: string }`

* Read only

* Details:

Contains parent-scope attribute bindings (except for class and style) that are not recognized (and extracted) as props. When a component doesnâ€™t have any declared props, this essentially contains all parent-scope bindings (except for class and style), and can be passed down to an inner component via v-bind="$attrs" - useful when creating higher-order components.
