# v-if

* Expects: any

* Usage:

Conditionally render the element based on the truthy-ness of the expression value. The element and its contained directives / components are destroyed and re-constructed during toggles. If the element is a `<template>` element, its content will be extracted as the conditional block.

This directive triggers transitions when its condition changes.

When used together with v-if, v-for has a higher priority than v-if. See the list rendering guide for details.
