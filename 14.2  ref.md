# ref

* Expects: string

ref is used to register a reference to an element or a child component. The reference will be registered under the parent component’s $refs object. If used on a plain DOM element, the reference will be that element; if used on a child component, the reference will be component instance:

```html
<!-- vm.$refs.p will be the DOM node -->
<p ref="p">hello</p>

<!-- vm.$refs.child will be the child component instance -->
<child-component ref="child"></child-component>
```

When used on elements/components with `v-for`, the registered reference will be an Array containing DOM nodes or component instances.

An important note about the ref registration timing: because the refs themselves are created as a result of the render function, you cannot access them on the initial render - they don’t exist yet! `$refs` is also non-reactive, therefore you should not attempt to use it in templates for data-binding.
