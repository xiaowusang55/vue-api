# v-once

* Does not expect expression

* Details:

Render the element and component once only. On subsequent re-renders, the element/component and all its children will be treated as static content and skipped. This can be used to optimize update performance.

```html
<!-- single element -->
<span v-once>This will never change: {{msg}}</span>
<!-- the element have children -->
<div v-once>
  <h1>comment</h1>
  <p>{{msg}}</p>
</div>
<!-- component -->
<my-component v-once :comment="msg"></my-component>
<!-- `v-for` directive -->
<ul>
  <li v-for="i in list" v-once>{{i}}</li>
</ul>
```
