# extends

* Type: Object | Function

* Details:

Allows declaratively extending another component (could be either a plain options object or a constructor) without having to use Vue.extend. This is primarily intended to make it easier to extend between single file components.

This is similar to mixins.

```js
var CompA = { ... }

// extend CompA without having to call `Vue.extend` on either
var CompB = {
  extends: CompA,
  ...
}
```
